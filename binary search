Binary search is a technique to search an item thereby finding its position in a sorted array.
It basically divides the sorted array into two parts by comparing the item with the middle element.
If it matches then the position is returned.
Else it continues searching in either of the two parts depending on its value.
This process continues and each time the item is compared with the updated mid value.
If mid value is not returned after the process ends then  item is not found.
