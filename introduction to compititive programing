Programming language:
    Most popular Programming languages used in contests are C++ , Python, and Java
 
C++ code template

    #include<bits/stdc++.h>

    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        //solution comes here
    }

Input and output is sometimes a bottleneck in program.
The following lines at the beginning of the code make input and output more efficient:

    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0)

Note that the newline "\n" works faster than endl , because endl always causes a flush operation.


Sometimes the program should read a whole line from the input, possibly containning spaces. This can 
be  accomplished by using the getline functon

    string s;
    getline(cin, s);

if the amount of data is unknows, the following loop is useful:
    while(cin >> x){
        //code
    }
